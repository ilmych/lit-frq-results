                    <p>The essay presents a strong thesis identifying forgetfulness as paradoxical and universally experienced, with sophisticated analysis of literary techniques and contradictions throughout the poem. To improve, focus on explicitly connecting poetic elements (tone, imagery, structure) to the thesis, refine thesis wording for clarity, and deepen analysis of how the poem's form reinforces its themes. Additionally, explore the emotional tone created by the contradictions and develop more connections between textual analysis and broader human significance.</p>

                            <p>The essay presents a defensible thesis in the first paragraph: "In the poem, the speaker argues that forgetfulness is a phenomenon that the universe will never understand, but will always experience together by illustrating forgetfulness as an inherently paradoxical idea that everybody mutually goes through." This thesis responds directly to the prompt by offering a specific interpretation of the speaker's views on forgetfulness. It goes beyond merely restating the prompt by identifying the paradoxical nature of forgetfulness as a central theme and asserting that the poem suggests this paradox is a universal experience that connects humanity. The thesis presents an arguable claim that will be supported throughout the essay.</p>

                            <p>This essay successfully demonstrates a sophisticated understanding of the poem's complexity through consistently integrated evidence and commentary. The analysis builds a clear line of reasoning about how the poem presents forgetfulness as paradoxical and universally experienced. The student effectively analyzes multiple literary techniques with specific examples and explains their significance to the poem's meaning.</p><p>The essay effectively examines the use of similes in the opening paragraph, particularly focusing on the juxtaposition created by describing forgetfulness as 'a song that, freed from beat and measure, wanders.' The student explains how this contradiction 'forces the reader to pause and question themselves,' establishing forgetfulness as inherently paradoxical. The analysis of metaphors and juxtaposition in the second paragraph further supports this line of reasoning, examining how forgetfulness is presented as both 'an old house in a forest,â€”or a child' (old vs. young) and 'white,â€”white as a blasted tree' (white vs. black). Each piece of evidence is consistently connected to the central argument about forgetfulness being inherently contradictory.</p><p>The analysis of the final line, 'I can remember much forgetfulness,' is particularly strong, as the student explains how this paradoxical statement serves to 'connect everybody at the end of the poem through the idea of universal experiences.' This creates a cohesive connection between the poem's use of contradictions and the universal nature of forgetfulness.</p>

                            <p>This essay demonstrates sophistication of thought through its exploration of paradox and juxtaposition as central to understanding the poem's treatment of forgetfulness. The analysis develops a complex literary argument by identifying the inherently contradictory nature of forgetfulness as the poem's core concern. The student's thesis effectively establishes this complex perspective: the poem portrays 'forgetfulness as an inherently paradoxical idea that everybody mutually goes through.'</p><p>The essay skillfully analyzes how the poem builds understanding through contradiction, noting how the opening similes present ideas that 'seemingly cannot be true at the same time.' By connecting these contradictions to the reader's experience ('forces the reader to pause and question themselves, almost as though they had forgotten what they just read'), the essay demonstrates sophisticated understanding of how poetic devices affect readers.</p><p>Particularly impressive is the essay's analysis of the metaphorical juxtapositions in the second paragraph, where it identifies how the poem pairs opposites ('both old and young' and 'white vs black') to represent the paradoxical nature of forgetfulness. The student insightfully connects these contradictions to universal experience, arguing that 'this confusion about forgetfulness extends beyond just the reader and to the greater universe.'</p><p>The essay's final paragraph demonstrates sophisticated thinking by moving beyond mere analysis of techniques to explore the implications of the poem's paradoxes for human connection: 'by going through it together, we are able to find solace in community.' This represents a mature analytical move that connects textual analysis to broader human significance.</p>

                    <h3>Summary</h3>
                    <p>The essay presents a clear thesis about Wharton's portrayal of social change but needs more specific analysis of how literary devices like diction and juxtaposition demonstrate changing values. Instead of simply identifying literary elements, develop a deeper analysis that connects specific word choices and the mother's contradictory behavior to broader social changes. Strengthen your argument by exploring the narrative complexities including generational tensions, moral hypocrisy, and the narrator's perspective that mediates between old and new social values.</p>

                            <p>The thesis statement "In 'New Year's Day' Wharton shows that social values and customs will inevitably change as time passes by contrasting the old and the new" effectively responds to the prompt's question about how Wharton shows changes in social values and customs. The thesis identifies a clear interpretive stance (that Wharton demonstrates the inevitability of social change) and mentions a specific literary technique (contrasting old and new) that will be analyzed in the essay. This provides a defensible interpretation that directly addresses the prompt's request to analyze literary devices used to show changing social values.</p>

The essay identifies two literary devices (diction and juxtaposition) but doesn't fully develop how they specifically contribute to showing social change. While the essay quotes phrases like "luxuriously warmed" and "searchingly illuminated" to discuss diction, the commentary oversimplifies how these word choices demonstrate changing social values, stating only that they "create a sense of class and wealth." Similarly, the discussion of juxtaposition identifies the mother's contradictory behavior but doesn't thoroughly explain how this specific literary technique reflects broader social change. The commentary generally remains at a surface level, making claims without fully developing the connection between the evidence and the thesis about inevitable social change.</p>

However, these observations remain underdeveloped. For instance, the discussion of the mother's contradictory behavior could have been expanded to analyze how this characterization contributes to Wharton's portrayal of societal hypocrisy or changing moral standards.</p><p>The analysis misses opportunities to explore significant narrative complexities, such as the generational tensions, the narrator's complex relationship with old New York social codes, or Wharton's subtle critique of society's preoccupation with scandal.

                    <p>The essay successfully develops a clear thesis about Gatsby's failed identity search through wealth as a commentary on the unattainability of the American Dream, supported by well-chosen textual evidence. To improve, focus on developing a more sophisticated analysis by exploring the complexities of Gatsby's identity transformation (both its successes and failures), examining how social class intersects with identity formation, and analyzing specific symbols that connect to American mythology. Additionally, strengthen the thesis by explicitly connecting Gatsby's story to the novel's broader critique of American society beyond just mentioning the American Dream.</p>

This thesis effectively responds to the prompt by identifying a specific character (Gatsby) engaged in a search (for personal identity through money), assessing the extent of success (ultimately unsuccessful), and analyzing how this contributes to the meaning of the work as a whole (interpretation of the book as a tale of the unattainability of the American dream). The thesis makes a defensible claim that could be argued with textual evidence, as demonstrated in the subsequent paragraphs.</p>

                            <p>This essay effectively provides specific evidence from The Great Gatsby to support all claims in its line of reasoning about Gatsby's failed search for identity through wealth and its connection to the American Dream. The response incorporates well-chosen evidence such as Gatsby's name change, his illegal activities selling bootleg alcohol, his desperate plea to Daisy ('Say you never loved him!'), and his ultimate downfall. The essay consistently explains how this evidence supports its argument that the American Dream is an illusion. The commentary effectively connects Gatsby's personal journey to broader themes, noting how 'by changing his name and compromising his integrity, Gatsby loses all the aspects of himself that make him a unique person.' The third paragraph offers particularly strong analysis by connecting Gatsby's experience to historical context: 'After a decade of lavish lifestyles, the people were thrust into a time of economic uncertainty.' This effectively ties Gatsby's individual failure to the collective disillusionment with the American Dream. The essay maintains a clear line of reasoning throughout, showing how Gatsby's search for identity through wealth parallels America's own complex relationship with materialism and success.</p>

The essay provides a straightforward reading of Gatsby's journey without exploring the nuanced complexities of identity formation, class dynamics, or the novel's layered critique of American society. The analysis recognizes basic connections between Gatsby's personal journey and the novel's themes but doesn't develop these into a complex literary argument that engages with the work's deeper implications or ambiguities. For example, while the essay mentions Gatsby's name change and compromised integrity, it doesn't explore the complexities of self-creation and performance central to the novel or analyze the tensions between different aspects of the American Dream that Fitzgerald critiques. The final paragraph offers a somewhat reductive 'cautionary tale' reading that oversimplifies the novel's rich exploration of American ideals, illusion, and reality.</p>
