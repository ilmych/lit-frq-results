                            <p>The essay contains a defensible thesis that presents a multi-faceted interpretation of the poem about forgetfulness. The thesis appears in the first paragraph: "This poem explores the concept of forgetfulness, employing a mix of vivid imagery and conceptual diction to reveal its conflicting nature. Forgetfulness is distinctly characterized as free form, careless, and perhaps unpredictable. Though it is certainly distinct in its characterization, there is still a sense of confusion and irony that is captured by the poem. Yet, what is perhaps most interesting is the conflicting tone of the poem that is simultaneously nostalgic and pleasant, while also being somber."</p><p>This thesis effectively addresses the prompt by identifying the speaker's views on forgetfulness (as having a "conflicting nature" that is both free and uncontrollable) while also noting specific poetic elements (imagery, diction, and tone) that help convey these views. The thesis presents a complex, defensible interpretation that goes beyond simply summarizing the poem.</p>

                            <p>This essay provides specific evidence from the poem to support claims in a line of reasoning about the conflicting nature of forgetfulness. The student effectively analyzes how imagery, diction, metaphor, and structure contribute to the poem's meaning. The essay demonstrates an understanding of how the poem presents forgetfulness as both uncontrollable yet omnipresent and inevitable.</p><p>The essay offers strong analysis of specific textual evidence, such as examining how forgetfulness is compared to "a song" that is "freed from beat and measure" and a bird that "coasts the wind unwearyingly." The student effectively explains how these metaphors characterize forgetfulness as unconstrained and unpredictable. There is also thoughtful examination of juxtapositions in the poem, like how forgetfulness is both "outspread and motionless."</p><p>The essay explains how at least one literary element (metaphor) contributes to the poem's meaning. The analysis of metaphors that compare forgetfulness to familiar, comforting images ("rain at night," "an old house," "a child") effectively supports the argument that forgetfulness has a nostalgic, inevitable quality.</p><p>However, while the essay offers insight into multiple literary elements, it doesn't consistently explain how all evidence supports the line of reasoning throughout. Some points about structure and enjambment are mentioned but not fully developed in relation to the overall argument about forgetfulness's nature.</p>

For example, when discussing the irony in "I can remember much forgetfulness," expand on how this paradox specifically reinforces your argument about forgetfulness being uncontrollable.</li><li>Develop your analysis of structural elements more thoroughly. You mention enjambment briefly, but could explain more specifically how this poetic technique reinforces the idea of forgetfulness as unconstrained.</li><li>When analyzing the color imagery ("white as a blasted tree"), connect this more explicitly to your argument about forgetfulness's nature. How does whiteness specifically contribute to the portrayal of forgetfulness as both pure and destructive?</li><li>Consider the progression of images throughout the poem more deeply. How does the sequence from natural elements (song, bird, rain) to human constructions (house) to human life (child) develop the poem's complex view of forgetfulness?</li><li>Examine the final lines about how forgetfulness "may stun the sybil into prophesy, Or bury the Gods" more fully to explain how these powerful actions relate to your argument about forgetfulness being both inevitable and uncontrollable.</li></ul>

                            <p>This essay demonstrates sophisticated literary analysis through its exploration of the complex and contradictory nature of forgetfulness. The student effectively develops a nuanced argument about how poetic elements work together to create meaning, particularly in examining the tensions between forgetfulness as both 'unconstrained' yet somehow comforting. The essay shows particular strength in how it analyzes contradictions and paradoxes within the poem's treatment of its subject, noting that forgetfulness is characterized as 'freed form, careless, and perhaps unpredictable' while also having elements that are 'pleasant' and 'comforting.' The analysis of how enjambment reinforces the conceptualization of forgetfulness as 'unconstrained' shows sophisticated understanding of how form supports content.</p><p>The student demonstrates exceptional insight when analyzing the juxtapositions in the poem, such as forgetfulness being both 'a bird that coasts' yet also 'outspread and motionless.' This observation shows awareness of multiple interpretive possibilities and the capacity to recognize complex relationships between poetic techniques and thematic meaning. The essay also insightfully explores the irony in the final line, identifying the 'bitter humor' that captures 'the idea that forgetfulness is out of our reach,' which reveals sophisticated thinking about the poem's paradoxical conclusion.</p><p>Throughout the essay, the student maintains a sophisticated analytical style, building on previous observations to develop a complex understanding of forgetfulness as something that is 'uncontrollable and always there' yet 'not seemingly an enemy, but rather an inevitable presence.' This progression of thought demonstrates mature literary reasoning that goes beyond surface-level interpretation.</p>

                    <p>The essay presents a strong thesis identifying literary devices Wharton uses to contrast old and modern New York social values, with effective evidence and analysis of diction, imagery, and narrative perspective. To improve, focus on developing a more sophisticated examination of how these elements work together rather than analyzing them in isolation. Specifically, explicitly connect imagery analysis to particular social values, explore the complex tensions in the narrator's perspective, and analyze the significance of irony and narrative structure in Wharton's commentary on social customs.</p>

                            <p>The thesis statement is effective and appears in the first paragraph: "Through the vivid imagery and diction used to illustrate the past, along with the characterization of the speaker's parents and grandparents, a portrayal of old New York City becomes clear. By employing the first-person point of view from the perspective of the speaker who has supposedly grown up in modern New York, Warton creates a very distinct [distinction] between the modern world and this depiction of the past. Thus, the social values become even more defined in their unfamiliarity, ultimately serving as a vivid reflection of old New York to the reader."</p><p>The thesis responds directly to the prompt by identifying specific literary devices (imagery, diction, characterization, and point of view) that Wharton uses to show changes in social values and customs. The thesis makes a defensible claim that these techniques create a contrast between old and modern New York, highlighting how social values have changed.</p>

                            <p>This essay earns 4 points for evidence and commentary. It effectively analyzes multiple literary elements (diction, imagery, and narrative perspective) and explains how they contribute to Wharton's portrayal of changing social values. The essay consistently provides specific textual evidence, such as the 'hiss' and 'venom' characterizing the mother's dialogue, the contrasting imagery of 'unwarmed and unlit houses' versus 'luxuriously warmed' modern homes, and the effect of the first-person perspective that aligns readers with the speaker. For each piece of evidence, the essay explains how it reveals the contrast between old New York's rigid social customs and the more pragmatic modern perspective. The analysis builds a coherent line of reasoning showing how Wharton uses these techniques to emphasize the 'cold, distant, rigid nature of old New York' in contrast with the present, ultimately illustrating how 'generations are characterized by the society they grew up in.'</p>

The essay particularly falls short in two key areas: (1) It doesn't sufficiently explore the tensions and complexities in the narrator's perspective - how he simultaneously distances himself from and remains connected to the social world he describes; and (2) It misses opportunities to develop a nuanced analysis of how Wharton uses irony and shifts in tone to comment on the social customs being described.</p>

                            <p>The essay presents a defensible thesis that directly addresses the prompt's question about a character's search for meaning or identity. The thesis appears in the first paragraph: "Noburu, a young boy who belongs to a gang of boys his age, subscribes to the ideals of nihilism. Thus, as a believer in the meaninglessness of life, he finds meaning in masculinity and its unification with femininity, as suggested by its repeated theme in the novel, as well as death which is distinctly represented through imagery. However, this is an ideal that has developed in isolation and has become the subject of his obsession. Therefore, when he is confronted with a challenge to this belief, his 'purpose' and understanding is called into question. Altogether this contributes to his characterization, but also a wider commentary on the fragility of self-created ideology and its dangers." The thesis clearly identifies Noburu's search (finding meaning through nihilism, masculinity, and death), suggests the extent to which it succeeds (it fails when challenged), and connects to the meaning of the work as a whole (commentary on the dangers of self-created ideology).</p>

                            <p>The essay effectively develops a line of reasoning about Noburu's search for meaning through nihilism and how his beliefs are challenged and ultimately proven fragile. The student consistently provides specific evidence from 'The Sailor Who Fell from Grace with the Sea' to support all claims in the line of reasoning. The evidence is well-selected and spans the entire novel, from Noburu's initial observation of his mother and Ryuji having sex to the final scenes of Ryuji's murder. Throughout each paragraph, the student generally explains how the evidence supports their argument about the fragility of ideology. For example, when discussing the kitten dissection scene, the student explains how the shift in imagery and tone reveals both 'the dangers and potency of the meaning created by Noburu and his gang, but also its inherent fragility as a created understanding of the universe.' Similarly, when analyzing Noburu's hesitation in the final scenes, the essay connects this to 'the struggle he faces when the meaning of life being in death and his idolization of Ryuji as masculine is challenged.' Each piece of evidence is clearly connected to the central argument about how Noburu's search for meaning through nihilistic philosophy contributes to the novel's commentary on 'the fragility of self-created ideology and its dangers.' The commentary consistently moves beyond plot summary to explain how the evidence demonstrates Noburu's psychological struggle and the broader implications of his search for meaning.</p>

                            <p>This essay demonstrates sophistication of thought through its nuanced exploration of Noburu's complex search for meaning in a nihilistic framework. The writer delves into the psychological tensions that drive Noburu's struggle, showing how his desperate attempts to create meaning through masculinity, unification with femininity, and death operate within a fragile, self-created ideology. The analysis moves beyond plot summary to explore the philosophical underpinnings of the character's search, noting how the novel portrays 'the dangers of an aimless perception of life, and how obsession and cult-like beliefs can fill this vacuum of disbelief.' The writer effectively analyzes the symbolism of the kitten dissection scene, noting the tonal shift and beautiful imagery that emerges when describing death, revealing the disturbing beauty the character finds in mortality. Additionally, the essay explores the internal conflicts Noburu experiences when his manufactured belief system encounters resistance, particularly in his conflicted feelings toward Ryuji. The analysis of tone is sophisticated, tracking Noburu's emotional shifts from 'ecstasy' to 'desperation' to 'conflict,' which effectively demonstrates the character's psychological complexity. Throughout, the writer consistently connects specific textual elements to the broader thematic exploration of nihilism, identity formation, and the dangers of extremist ideologies.</p>
